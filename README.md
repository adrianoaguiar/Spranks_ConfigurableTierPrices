Spranks_ConfigurableTierPrices
==============================
This extension changes the way Magento calculates tier prices of configurable products. You can now add different variants of a configurable product to the cart and you will get the tier price for the total quantity of all variants in the cart.

Have a look at the extension readme file located under [https://github.com/sprankhub/Spranks_ConfigurableTierPrices/tree/master/app/code/community/Spranks/ConfigurableTierPrices](https://github.com/sprankhub/Spranks_ConfigurableTierPrices/tree/master/app/code/community/Spranks/ConfigurableTierPrices).
